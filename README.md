# Skongk
This is a game that I made for the Cryptid Jam on itch.io.  
You can find the game here: https://galbenshire.itch.io/skongk-the-skunk-ape  
I made this repository to display the source code, and as a show case of my game development skills.

I can only consider this game a prototype, due to how primitive it is, especially in regards to graphics.
